# Thermal-Runaway-Prediction-using-CNN-LSTM
This project develops a deep learning–IoT framework to predict and detect abnormal heat generation (AHG) in EV battery packs before thermal runaway occurs. Raw voltage, current, and temperature signals are first smoothed using rolling statistics and Savitzky–Golay filters, then compressed via PCA into a lower-dimensional feature set. Sliding‐window sequences of these features feed into a hybrid CNN–peephole‑LSTM model with attention, which forecasts six cell temperatures over a 48‑step horizon. A Random Adjacent Optimization Method (RAOM) automatically tunes window size, filter depths, and kernel widths rather than relying on manual grid searches. After training, predicted temperature trajectories are used to compute a “real” heat proxy (summing expected temperature rises) and compared against “normal” heat dissipation (computed from measured voltages and internal resistance). If their difference exceeds a calibrated threshold, an AHG alarm is issued.
